## Linear regression to Predict MPG

Below is a screenshot of the output of the linear regression as well as the summary stats:

1) *Which variables/coefficients provided a non-random amount of variance to the mpg values in the dataset?*
  - The **Spoiler Angle** and **AWD** variables were non-random.

2) *Is the slope of the linear model considered to be zero? Why or why not?*
  - It is not for any of the variables tested in the mulitple regression model. Therefore, the slope cannot be considered zero for this model.

3) *Does this linear model predict mpg of MechaCar prototypes effectively? Why or why not?*
  - It does because it returns an adjusted R-squared value of .6825. 
     * This means there is a good probability there is a relationship between response variable (mpg) and the other predictor variables in the dataset.
